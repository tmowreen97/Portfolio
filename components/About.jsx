          <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, I grew up with an unexpected love for math. Most people dread Algebra and Calculus, but those were actually my favorite subjects growing up. I could work long hours solving a problem, just for that feeling of accomplishment for when I do solve it. This drove my passion for problem solving, and soon after my college career, I found a love for programming and became a full stack developer. </p> <br/>
          <p>Programming, to me, is creative problem-solving and it gives me the same feeling of accomplishment I sought growing up. With my customer experience background and my passion for developing and creative expression, I strive to create user-friendly, efficient yet engaging applications. I hope to continue to develop my skillset, and contribute to technology that improves our way of life. </p>
